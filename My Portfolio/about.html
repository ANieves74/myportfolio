    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm <strong>Alejandro Nieves</strong>, a 37-year-old aspiring Fullstack Developer currently studying at <strong>CodeAcademy</strong>.  
        Although I have been formally learning web development for only six months, my interest in HTML, CSS, and web technologies goes back many years.  
        From a young age, I have been fascinated by how websites are built and how interactive experiences come to life online. This early curiosity has grown into a real passion for creating clean, functional, and user-friendly applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the past six months, I have focused on building a solid foundation in frontend technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and I am exploring modern frameworks like React.js and Node.js.  
        I enjoy experimenting with code, solving challenges, and learning best practices for responsive design, accessibility, and performance optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to contribute to projects that combine technical excellence with engaging user experiences. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn from others and apply my growing skills to meaningful applications.  
        I am motivated by continuous learning, creativity, and the excitement of seeing ideas transform into fully functional web projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately, I aspire to become a well-rounded Fullstack Developer capable of delivering complete solutions that are both visually appealing and technically robust, while continuing to grow and explore new technologies in this ever-evolving field.
